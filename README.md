## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Outfit)

### What I learned

This project allowed me to practice the basics of **Flexbox** for aligning items both vertically and horizontally in a responsive way. I also improved my understanding of mobile-first design and learned how to make content adaptable for different screen sizes.

Hereâ€™s a snippet from my CSS that showcases how I used Flexbox:

```css
body {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    background-color: #D5E1EF;
}
```
And this is an example of how I handled responsive design:

```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {
    .card {
        width: 90%;
        max-width: 280px;
        padding: 1rem;
    }
}
```

### Continued development
In future projects, I want to focus more on creating responsive components with better accessibility, as well as experimenting with CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
